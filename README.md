## Prompts

I wanna make a GBA Pokémon type game, but with a real time battle system and using animals instead of Pokémon.

It's gonna be a web application, and I want to make it very performant (yet easy and fun to work on for most devs with some web dev experience, to encourage contributions long term—I would say development speed and fun would have to trump performance).

What are some ways I could go about this? 

I’ve looked at Phaser, p5, GDevelop, Babylon, Unity, GoDot etc., and I’m a little drawn to doing it without a framework at this point, but not sure if that would be overwhelming
