## Pixel Art and Level Design

If you want to work on pixel art or level design, you need:

- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) (for pixel art) *$15-20*\*
- [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) (for level design) *FREE*

> [!TIP]
> \*You can [compile Aseprite from source](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/main/INSTALL.md#platforms), if you don't want to buy it, or try [LibreSprite](https://libresprite.github.io/) as a free alternative
>
> Just make sure you're not breaking Aseprite support
